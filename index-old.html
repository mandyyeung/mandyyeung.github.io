				How the Internet Works</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p><img src="../images/blog/2015/01/browser.png" alt="What happens in the browser?" /> The internet - it’s become so ubiquitous and indispensable that most of us often take it for granted. But, this is important– how does the magic work? What actually happens when we type in a URL on the browser and hit enter? Let’s take a look.</p>

<!-- First off, let's check out the anatomy of a URL (that stands for uniform resource locator)--
http://www.google.com/about -->

<h3 id="enter-an-internet-address-on-your-browser">1. Enter an internet address on your browser</h3>

<p>For example, let’s say we want to visit Google. We would type in, <strong>google.com</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="send-the-request-to-the-internet">2. Send the request to the internet</h3>

<p>Your computer is connected to the internet via your router (and/or modem) and the service is supplied by your ISP (internet service provider). Your ISP provides multiple servers to store and transfer data- NAP (network access protection) server and a DNS (domain name server). The domain google.com is an easy way to remember how to locate Google on the internet, but it’s actually a layer on top of Google’s numerical IP (internet protocol) address. The DNS translates the URL into the IP address to connect you with the web page. For example, you can reach google.com by typing in http://74.125.224.72/.</p>

<h3 id="connect-with-the-web-page">3. Connect with the web page</h3>

<p>With the IP address uncovered, your browser establishes a connection to the world wide web through HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol). HTTP is the standard protocol for communicating with the web, which is just made up of interconnected hypertext documents. Your request for google.com transverses through the cloud until it reaches google.com’s ISP.</p>

<h3 id="obtain-and-receive-data-back-to-your-browser">4. Obtain and receive data back to your browser</h3>

<p>Once google.com’s ISP processes your request to get the website, it sends data back to your browser, loading all the visual goodies such as the day’s Google doodle and the search input box. Ta-da!</p>

		<p><strong>1988</strong> - Born</p>

<p><strong>1990-1995</strong> - Grew up in Hong Kong, one of the best cities in the world. Discovered I really enjoyed math and was quite good at it.</p>

<p><strong>1995</strong> - Moved to Queens, New York City</p>

<p><strong>1995-1999</strong> - Elementary school, graduated as valedictorian</p>

<p><strong>1999-2002</strong> - Middle school, graduated as valedictorian. Learned HTML and CSS to make fansites and to decorate my Xanga blog.</p>

<p><strong>2002-2006</strong> - Stuyvesant High School. Learned a lot about myself through a variety of jobs held starting in Freshman year. Worked for a greeting card company in SoHo, a pediatrician’s office in Chinatown, a law office in Midtown, a chocolatier at Rockefeller Center, a South Korean skincare company in SoHo, an advertising company in NoHo, a recruiting agency in Midtown, and a summer enrichment program for children in Flushing. Never occurred to me to explore my interest in web design and development, because as a first-generation high school student, I thought my only career options were doctor, lawyer, or engineer.</p>

<p><strong>2006-2007</strong> - As a civil engineering major, attended the Cooper Union in the East Village on a full scholarship</p>

<p><strong>2007-2010</strong> - Transferred to University of Southern California (USC), opting to take on student loans for opportunities to see the world beyond NYC, to study abroad in Hong Kong, and to learn how to live on my own, 2,815 miles away. Worth every penny, and laid the foundations for me to start seeing there’s more to life than the immigrant mentality, which was all I’d known up until then.</p>

<p><strong>2010</strong> - Participated in OCAC’s language-immersive program in Taiwan. Continued to expand my horizons by meeting and making friends with my classmates, who came from all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>2011-2014</strong> - Field Engineer for Turner Construction at the New York Police Academy. I LOVE buildings and building them, but couldn’t stand inefficiencies in construction management processes (changes to drawings during construction, uncoordinated details in drawings and specs, change order process, punchlist…). In my free time, converted our Excel-based change order workflow to an Access database. This improved the way we did things, but it was not enough for me. I didn’t want to be limited to the Desktop. I started wondering how to build on the web…</p>

<p><strong>2014</strong> - Took 6 months off from work to attend the Flatiron School. Best. Decision. Ever. I love the NYC tech community, especially Meetup groups like Women Who Code (so much so that I now volunteer with them). Invigorated and empowered to do more for my beloved construction management community. Really, really, want to help make their lives easier with software..</p>

<p>That’s a high-level look at my 26 years of life thus far. What will 2015 bring? I see some really cool and exciting opportunities, a lot more yoga &amp; traveling, diving deeper into Ruby and Javascript, honing my budding entrepreneurial spirit, oh, and definitely some more Github commits. :)</p>

<p>Happy New Year!!</p>

				Node.js CLI App to Check Stock Prices</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>This is a simple command line app that uses node.js and the <a href="http://dev.markitondemand.com/">Markit on Demand API</a> to retrieve stock prices. The goal is to be able to obtain results for multiple tickers through a command like so (the following checks for prices of Apple, Facebook, and Yelp stocks) –</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>node app.js aapl fb yelp

<span class="comment">// FB (Facebook, Inc.) is $78.03.</span>
<span class="comment">// AAPL (Apple Inc) is $110.43.</span>
<span class="comment">// YELP (Yelp Inc) is $54.7.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To start, let’s create a file called stocks.js. We will create our app.js later to refer to the functions in stocks.js.</p>

<p>We want to make a get request to the Markitondemand API, so let’s make use of the HTTP server and client in Node.js.–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> http = require(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">http</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The way that the API works, we need to pass in a ticker parameter at the end of this call: <code>http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/json?symbol=</code>. Let’s create a function called stockLookup that takes one argument, the ticker, and we’ll use Node&#8217;s <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_get_options_callback">http.get</a> method to access the API–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">stockLookup</span>(ticker){
  <span class="keyword">var</span> request = http.get(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/json?symbol=</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> + ticker), <span class="comment">// callback function goes here!</span>
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now the <code>http.get</code> method takes a callback function with a <code>response</code> argument. The <code>response</code> is an instance of <strong>http.IncomingMessage</strong> and is the response to the get request. We want this callback function to receive the JSON data from the API and parse it to return the data in the format of “TICKER (Company Name) is $X.XX.” This is what a sample API call will return–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/json?symbol=yelp</span>
{
  <span class="key"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">Status</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">SUCCESS</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>,

  <span class="key"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">ChangePercentYTD</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>: -<span class="float">20.6671501087745</span>,

  <span class="key"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">Open</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="float">54.68</span>
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the values we want are “Name” and “LastPrice.” The ticker is already passed in to the original API call. With that information in mind, this is our callback function that logs the formatted result into our console–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// function stockLookup(ticker){ ...,</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span>(response){
      <span class="keyword">var</span> body = <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>;
      response.on(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">data</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(chunk){
        body += chunk;
      });
      response.on(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">end</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(){
        <span class="keyword">var</span> stock = JSON.parse(body);
        <span class="keyword">var</span> price = stock.LastPrice;
        <span class="keyword">var</span> name = stock.Name;
        <span class="keyword">var</span> result = ticker + <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">(</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> + name + <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">) is $</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> + price + <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">.</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>;
        console.log(result);
      });
    }
  )};

module.exports.get = stockLookup;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that Node.js streams emit <code>data</code> events each time they receive a chunk of data, and they emit <code>end</code> when they are finished. We continuously save these chunks of data received into an empty string variable named <code>body</code>, and format the data once we have received all of it. After we close out our <code>stockLookup</code> function, we export it so we can call it in our app.js file. Here, we name the exported function <strong>get</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, let’s create our app.js file–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> stockPrices = require(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">./stocks</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>);
stockPrices.get(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">aapl</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>);
stockPrices.get(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">fb</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>);
stockPrices.get(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">yelp</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>);
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this point, if you run <code>node app.js</code> in your console, you should get the stock prices of AAPl, FB, and YELP. However, having to provide the tickers within app.js is not dynamic, and calling stocks one at a time is not DRY. One way to improve our code is to pass in an array of tickers and iterate through, calling stockLookup on each ticker. To do this, we can make use of the global object <strong>process</strong>. Let’s check out process in the console. In your app.js file, add this line–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>console.log(process);
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Run <code>node app.js aapl fb yelp</code> in your terminal and you will see a long output with information on the line of code you’re running. Particularly, at the key <code>argv</code>, you will see this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>argv:
[ <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">node</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>,
<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">/[path to your file]/app.js</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>,
<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">aapl</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>,
<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">fb</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>,
<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">yelp</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> ]
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Oh look, <code>argv</code> is an array of your command, and we can retrieve the array of tickers we are looking up by calling <code>process.argv.slice(2)</code>, because the tickers start at index 2. This is our updated app.js file–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> stockPrices = require(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">./stocks2</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>);
<span class="keyword">var</span> stocks = process.argv.slice(<span class="integer">2</span>); <span class="comment">// slice from index 2 of the array till the end</span>
stocks.forEach(stockPrices.get);
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Much better. Now, just tidy up our stocks.js file by refactoring and adding error messages. This is our final result –</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> http = require(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">http</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);

  console.log(result);
}

<span class="comment">// Print error messages</span>

  console.error(error.message);
}

				Concurrency and Parallelism</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>Distilled into layman’s terms–</p>

<p><strong>Concurrency</strong>
When multiple tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, through shared resources. Tasks may be, but are not necessarily, running at the same instant.</p>

<p>Example of non-concurrency: 1 server, 1 job queue with multiple jobs. Jobs are serviced to completion one by one, sequentially.</p>

<p><img src="../images/blog/2014/12/nocnop.png" alt="No concurrency nor parallelism" /></p>

<p>Example of concurrency: 1 server, 2 or more job queues. Server shares time with all the 1st jobs in queues. At any instant, there is only one job being serviced.</p>

<p><img src="../images/blog/2014/12/cnop.png" alt="Concurrency, no parallelism" /></p>

<p><strong>Parallelism</strong>
Don’t be confused by their similar dictionary meanings…concurrency and parallelism are NOT the same things! Parallelism is when multiple tasks are being performed at the same time.</p>

<p>Example of parallelism: 2 or more servers, 1 job queue. Two jobs are performed at the same instant. There is no concurrency because the servers are not sharing time and the 3rd job has to wait until one of the servers free up.</p>

<p><img src="../images/blog/2014/12/nocp.png" alt="Parallelism only" /></p>

<p>Example of parallelism AND concurrency: 2 or more servers, 2 or more job queues.

<p>The CNAME file just contains the domain name you want to use with this page, without any protocol identifiers. For example, instead of http://www.yourdomain.com, just type in yourdomain.com in your file.</p>

<p>Next, update the DNS (domain name system) record for your domain name with your provider. Login to the control panel at your domain registrar. Navigate to your domain details and look for a link to your DNS settings. There, you’ll have two options.</p>

<p>If you are using a root domain (yourwebsite.com), set up a <strong>A record</strong> to point to your Github page. As of today, you can point to this IP address: <strong>192.30.252.153</strong>. For the latest information, check out the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/">Github help page</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using a subdomain (sub.yourwebsite.com), set up a <strong>CNAME record</strong> that points to your Github subdomain (ex. <strong>username</strong>.github.io).</p>

<p>Don’t worry if your custom domain doesn’t work right away. Just give it some time (up to 24 hours) for the DNS changes to take effect.</p>

				Intro to Python</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>I’ve been learning Python with the help of my mentor at StackExchange, and I’m happy to report that it’s been a lot of fun! At the Flatiron School, we focused a lot on Ruby, and Ruby will always be my first true programming language love, but it’s awesome to explore other languages to continue learning programming from different perspectives.</p>

<p>Python is very similar to Ruby. So far, there are just some syntax and terminology differences, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python does not close methods and conditionals with the ‘end’ keyword</li>
  <li>Python uses colons to declare the start of an indented block</li>
  <li>Ruby arrays are Python lists</li>
  <li>Ruby hashes are Python dictionaries</li>
  <li>Ruby uses booleans true and false; Python uses True and False</li>
  <li>To read documentation on the command line, use pydoc, (ri in Ruby)</li>
  <li>Python’s interactive prompt (Ruby’s irb) is python. Exit irb with the keyword ‘exit’. Use ‘exit()’ in python.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like Ruby, Python comes pre-installed on Mac computers. To run Python scripts, which end with a .py extension (Ruby’s .rb), run python filename.py. For more help with getting Python up and running on your Mac, look through this blog post from HackerCodex.</p>

<p>Let’s check out Ruby vs. Python through code examples:</p>

<p>If/else statements:</p>

<p>As you can see, going from Ruby to Python is mostly learning new syntax. They’re both object-oriented programming languages, so the jump is not as crazy as say, going from Ruby to Java, which is something I am looking forward to learn about at this week’s Women Who Code Meetup, Intro to Java!</p>

				Blogging With Middleman and Github Pages</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>I’ve been wanting to start a personal finance blog for the longest time, but I never get to keep one going. Now that I’ve got experience maintaining a blog for more than five months (thanks Flatiron School!!), I feel like I can really do this. Plus, I’ve had an eye on a suitable domain name for the blog for the longest time, and I was just recently able to snatch it up for a reasonable price (a couple months ago, it cost around $1,000 to buy it). My boyfriend claims he came up with the name for me, but I’m pretty sure I came up with it myself. Either way, I am now the proud owner of yeungmoney.com, and I can’t wait to get started.</p>

<p>For this blog, I use WordPress, and I’ve tried Jekyll on another blog, but the former nearly gave me a heart attack when my hosting company suspended my account and I thought I’d lost all my posts, and the latter is good, but too bulky for me. Enter Middleman, a light-weight static-site generator that works well with blogs too. A CMS is nice to use for blogging, but it’s not a must-have for me. I prefer to keep my posts as pages and not use a database for Yeung Money.</p>

<p><img src="../images/blog/2014/12/middleman.png" alt="Middleman logo" /></p>

<p>Here’s a quick run down on how to get a Middleman blog up and up on Github Pages. It’s super simple but quite useful, and leaves you with a lot of room to customize the static portions of your site.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman-blog">middleman-blog</a> gem on your computer, via the command line:</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  gem install middleman-blog
  ~~~</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cd into the local directory where you are parking your blog and initialize a project:</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  middleman init blogname –template=blog
  ~~~</p>

<p>This will generate the following:</p>

<p>~~~
  blogname
  |- source
  |- images #subfolder
  |- javascripts #subfolder
  |- stylesheets #subfolder
  |- 2012-01-01-example-article.html.markdown
  |- calendar.html.erb
  |- feed.xml.builder
  |- index.html.erb
  |- layout.erb
  |- tag.html.erb
  |- .gitignore
  |- config.rb
  |- Gemfile
  |- Gemfile.lock
  ~~~</p>

<ol>
  <li>Note that there’s an example article markdown file already in your project. Remove it and add your own:</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  bundle exec middleman article “My first blog post”
  ~~~</p>

<p>This generates a blog post file under the source directory. Compose away!</p>

<ol>
  <li>When you’re ready to check it out on your local server, run:</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  bundle exec middleman
  ~~~</p>

<p>and go to http://localhost:4567</p>

<ol>
  <li>To publish your blog on to Github pages, which provides free hosting for static web pages, add the gem to your Gemfile:</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  gem ‘middleman-gh-pages’
  ~~~</p>

<ol>
  <li>Then, generate a Rakefile:</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  touch Rakefile
  ~~~</p>

<ol>
  <li>Require the gem in the Rakefile:</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  require ‘middleman-gh-pages’
  ~~~</p>

<p>If you check your rake tasks in your console, you should now see build and publish rake tasks.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have committed your changes to git. If you have uncommitted changes, you will get an error running the following command, telling you your repo is “dirty.” To deploy with a dirty repo, use the second command (but why would you want to??):</li>
</ol>

<p class="language-ruby">~~~
  bundle exec rake publish
  bundle exec rake publish ALLOW_DIRTY=true
  ~~~</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check out your live Github page at GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME. To set up a custom domain, check out <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages">Github Help Pages</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make your site pretty, enjoy, have fun, and keep blogging!!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

				Thank You</a>

	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>Prior to attending Flatiron School for the last 5 months, I knew there was something missing in my life. I loved working for Turner and I was truly happy in the construction management industry, but there was just some sort of void to fill. I disliked the routine of work, eat, sleep, repeat, and I wanted to make sure I was making the most of my twenties, productivity wise, while I got them. This feeling had been stewing since last August, when one of my favorite people and awesome partner-in-crime at work, Barry, left the jobsite. Initially, I thought it was a problem I could solve with money. I aimed to make six figures in a year, because society supports that as a nice-sounding achievement to have in my back pocket by age 25. Reaching this goal did help me feel really good– for about a week, but I quickly realized that my issue wasn’t money. I missed the super fun times of great team work with Barry and the rush you get when you make meaningful contributions to a project. On the weekends and when I had free time, I hated the feeling of being “bored” and having “nothing to do”. I wanted to make myself useful, and I needed to do something about it.</p>

<p>At work, I was able to identify inefficiencies, such as the process of using multiple Excel sheets to deal with relational data. I helped alleviate these issues by converting the system to Access, the only database tool available on my company-regulated computers. However, desktop-based Access, while an improvement for the tasks from Excel, has its limitations. It’s not that pretty, you can only deploy to Sharepoint, and it’s a drag and drop system that curbs customization. I knew there must be better ways to deal with data, more efficient ways, and eventually Google (or was it <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/154999795159805952">Bloomberg’s resolution?</a>) led me to the doors of Codecademy, where I discovered Ruby and started learning programming. I tried teaching myself with online resources, but it became apparent that I needed some guidance or at the very least, a support community. Back then, I did not know any software developers nor did I know anything about the awesome tech Meetups in NYC. Fortuitously, I stumbled upon the Flatiron School’s web development program application less than two weeks before they were due, worked hard to prepare for two rounds of Skype interviews, and got accepted.</p>

<p>Through this program, I’ve discovered a new world, one where I don’t have to get too frustrated at problems, because I now have tools that can help me solve them, work around them, or mitigate them. Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, jQuery, and the concepts of programmatic thinking have given me a fresh perspective on life. Before Flatiron School, I was already a total Zen Master when confronted with issues and challenges. Now, I’m a Zen Master with a swiss army knife of web development tools ready to tackle anything, anytime. I feel empowered and enlightened, and I am so excited to never be bored again. I can now fill all my free time with fun and useful side projects. Instead of sitting on the sidelines throwing out “Someone should make a ___ app” ideas, I can now transform ideas into reality with code.</p>

<p>Thank you, Flatiron School, for the invaluable knowledge and resources you have given me. I love my teachers and classmates, and I am so thankful I chose to do the fellowship program. Instead of continuing a life and career path of doing what I do because that’s just how life is, I am embarking on my own path where I do what I do because I can, I want to, and I am happy to.</p>

				Nested Data Structures</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>Last week was the first full week of Flatiron School (hard to believe, because I feel like I’ve been doing this for much longer…they were not kidding about the program being “fully immersive”!). We did nested data structures on Wednesday, and I am happy to report that I was much more comfortable with these labs than I was with section 3 of the ruby assessment. Pardon the corniness, but this learning process that I’m going through– even at such early stages– is so beautiful and magical. I can’t tell you when exactly I “got” things like nested arrays within nested hashes within more nested hashes, but I sure remember being stuck on the assessment and feeling like this is going to be a loooong semester of pain. It’s not that anything is easy right now, but at least I know where to start and how to navigate a nested data structure problem when I see one. Avi, Blake, and Steven are so awesome at encouraging us not to give up, telling us that they understand being stumped and feeling like the dumbest person in the world when they were beginning too, and they often talk about how things will eventually just “click” if you keep working at it and trying your best. Well, they are totally right (of course)!</p>

<p>So last week I was working on a lab called “collections practice volume 2.” It was made up of 8 nested array questions. The last 3 or so questions were quite difficult for me, but they were really fun because these labs have become like logic puzzles I am addicted to solving. I love see the green texts when running rspec. I do some major internal fist-pumping when they come up on the screen. Anyway, I digress. So I had to spend a lot of time on these last couple of problems, but I finished the lab at around 5:40PM and felt really happy, because I totally needed a break. It was the end of the day, I was tired, and when the pull request didn’t go through like it normally would, I decided I’d do a manual mindless “fix” instead of investigating the issue- I’d just re-clone the repo and move my work over. Of course that idea never works out when you’re not quite paying attention to what you’re doing, and long story short I lost the work I had just spent hours on. Yes, I understand that’s the whole point of Git to prevent something like this from happening…so now I have this incident to remind myself to commit early and commit often! Okay so long story short, it sucked but I didn’t have time to dwell on my mistake. I gave myself approximately 2 seconds to grieve and then moved on to redo my work.</p>

<p>In a way it was a good exercise, right? Theoretically I should’ve been able to fly through the assignment the second time around since I had already solved it once. That was the case for the first couple of questions, but when I reached the problems I had previously struggled with, I found that I couldn’t remember my solutions exactly, though I recalled my logic and approach. For the problem I struggled with the most, I daresay I came up with an even better solution the second time around. Here’s how I did it.</p>

<p>Problem (in the form of the RSpec test):</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>describe <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">#merge_data</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> <span class="keyword">do</span>

  <span class="comment"># Question 6</span>

  it <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">combines two nested data structures into one</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> <span class="keyword">do</span>
    expect(merge_data(keys, data)).to eq(merged_data)
  <span class="keyword">end</span>

<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These were the parameters (again, from the RSpec test):</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>keys = [ { <span class="symbol">:first_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">blake</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> },
         { <span class="symbol">:first_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">ashley</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>} ]
data = [ { <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">blake</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> =&gt; {
  <span class="symbol">:awesomeness</span> =&gt; <span class="integer">10</span>,
  <span class="symbol">:height</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">74</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>,
  <span class="symbol">:last_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">johnson</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>},
  <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">ashley</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> =&gt; {
    <span class="symbol">:awesomeness</span> =&gt; <span class="integer">9</span>,
    <span class="symbol">:height</span> =&gt; <span class="integer">60</span>,
    <span class="symbol">:last_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">dubs</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>} } ]
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So the task was to take these two nested arrays, match keys to data based on the name (see how the values of the hash in keys match the keys of the hash in data?), and return a hash that looks like this–</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>merged_data = [ { <span class="symbol">:first_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">blake</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>,
                  <span class="symbol">:awesomeness</span> =&gt; <span class="integer">10</span>,
                  <span class="symbol">:height</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">74</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>,
                  <span class="symbol">:last_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">johnson</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> },
                { <span class="symbol">:first_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">ashley</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>,
                  <span class="symbol">:awesomeness</span> =&gt; <span class="integer">9</span>,
                  <span class="symbol">:height</span> =&gt; <span class="integer">60</span>,
                  <span class="symbol">:last_name</span> =&gt; <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">dubs</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> } ]
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first thing I did for this problem, to help myself understand it better, was to come up with a way to “hard code” it so I can see what I want my program to do.</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">merge_data</span>(arr1,arr2)
  merged =[ ]
  merged &lt;&lt; arr1[<span class="integer">0</span>].merge(arr2[<span class="integer">0</span>][<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">blake</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>])
  merged &lt;&lt; arr1[<span class="integer">1</span>].merge(arr2[<span class="integer">0</span>][<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">ashley</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>])
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I created an empty array called merged which is the container for my results. “arr1″ is the keys array and “arr2″ is the data array.  I can see that, for my hard code answer, I want to merge the first hash of arr1 with the hash of arr2 with key of the name. So on line 3 of my code, I used arr1[0] to access the first element of the keys (for “blake”). Since arr2 is an array with just one element (the hash), I use arr2[0] to access that hash, and we access hashes by keys, so I followed it with the key, “blake”. The merge method for hashes take two hashes and creates a new one with data from first the hash that’s left of the method, then from the hash to the right. I use the “shovel” method, (the «) to append the result of this merge into my merge hash. After doing the same thing for “ashley” (note that arr1 has two elements and the element for “ashley” is at index 1), I have a draft of what I need to code. Since the last line of the method is returned, I do not have to call merged again.</p>

<p>Ok, now for the fun stuff.</p>

<p>I see that I need to iterate over arr1 (I’m tipped off by seeing both arr1[0] and arr1[1] in my hard code). To do this, I use the .each_index method. Within this iteration, I also want to look through arr2, but I am targeting specific matches at this level. I use the .keys method to iterate through the hash, and for each of these two keys, I want to merge arr2 and arr1 if the key of arr2 matches the first name of arr1. After I finish the nested iterations, I need to return the merged array.</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">merge_data</span>(arr1,arr2)
  merged =[]
  arr1.each_index <span class="keyword">do</span> |i|
    arr2[<span class="integer">0</span>].keys.each <span class="keyword">do</span> |name|
      merged &lt;&lt; arr1[i].merge(arr2[<span class="integer">0</span>][name]) <span class="keyword">if</span> name == arr1[i][<span class="symbol">:first_name</span>]
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
  merged
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
